## Development

At the cost of losing a few years of sanity and youth, I decided once more to try and go above and beyond as I was tackling yet another awesome challenge from Frontend Mentor. 

To this day I still feel that the creative freedom that these projects allow you is one of the most beautiful aspects about coding. Every idea is worth testing and every creative endeavor is worth exploring.

With that in mind, I approached this project with the goal to try and bring out this beautiful design's full potential.

One of the most difficult tasks for this project was creating the SVG animations for the Hero section. I had never tried animating such complex SVGs before, so you can imagine what a hassle it must've been to find all the right SVG path and animate them correctly. 

On top of that, there was the responsive design aspect to handle as well which proved to be a hassle too when it came to these SVGs. 

To be frank, it became quite discouraging because I had spent hours trying to make it work and I was on the verge of giving up on the implementation of the animation ideas I had for this project. But the paradoxical twist is that exactly when you feel you've reached a dead end, that's when you keep pushing forward because you're closer to the solution than you realize.

Another animation consideration I had for this project was the three circles illustration in the Hero section. Perhaps it is indeed possible to animate the SVG in the way I intended, but I couldn't make it work despite having tried editing the SVG design file and also re-create it on my own in Figma. That's how I ended up just re-creating that SVG using HTML and SCSS - turned out quite well, all things considered :D

Because I first tackled the Home page design and only afterwards the Sign Up page, it took me a while to realize the implications of the dropdown field for the form.

Not only it was pretty impossible to customize the native element the way I intended, but even recreating the HTML structure based on the design. That's how I ended up creating my first completely custom dropdown field component that had the look, feel, and functionality I needed for this project.

For the form, I felt that there must be a little UX touch at the end after you click on the submit button. This led me to adding a simple overlay animation with a confirmation message that'd animate after the form was successfully submitted (mind you, all fields have to be valid for that to work)

I'm pretty content with how the final version of the project turned out, even though I still feel that a few more tweaks and improvements can be done here and there.

A big reason of why I managed to develop this project at a much faster pace than usual was the structuring of the project that allowed for a lot of reusability, flexibility, and ease of maintanibility. Consider this a reminder of why these things are so powerful when it comes to efficient development ;)

Thanks for taking the time to read this and I'll see you in the next challenge!
